# Daemons

I will create daemons from time to time...

# Run

Go to the directory of the daemon and type the following command:

```
./run
```

# How To Daemonize

How to daemonize process? Just add '&' (ampersand) sign to the end of the command:

```
./run &
```

Thats it! Now daemon is working... silently... writing all info to the 'logs.txt' by default

Happy sherevo!
